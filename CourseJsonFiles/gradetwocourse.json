    "description" : "Young children are filled with wonder and excitement. They are hungry for science and are easily amazed. Even when we challenge them to stretch and explore concepts that some might feel are too abstract, we give them opportunities to grasp bits and pieces of the ideas. Each time children are exposed to the experience, they absorb greater levels of understanding of the same concepts. Through unstructured exploration, they will develop their imagination & creativity skills.Every kid has the potential to be an Innovator. From the time a kid is born, they are inspired to imagine and create solutions for their own problems. However, with the traditional learning and teaching practices of the current education system they canâ€™t identify themselves as innovators. This handbook is designed to help these kids to discover themselves and lead them towards the creative community.",
